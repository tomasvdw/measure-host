# Design



## Assumptions

* The number of keys is limited and hence not optimize key-lookup.
* Clients can misbehave, and keep connections open.
* Client will not be malicious

## Setup

The key/values will be kept in memory using as a sorted array to allow for 
fast lookups.

The persistence format is the same XML format as returned to the client

The application uses three modules with a simple linear dependency

    main.c           The tcp server; This uses a select() loop to process parallel connections
      |
      |  request_process() 
      V
    request.c        Request handling; parses and handles a request from a client
      |
      |  measurements_set() / measurements_get()
      V
    measurements.c   Storage; maintains current measurements and (de)serializes them to disk


## Parallel connections

The server uses select() to prevent read() and accept() operations from blocking; this way it can
handle multiple parallel connections.

The response are send using a blocking write(), as the responses are small, they will fit in the receive buffer
on the clients end, and hence only block during the send itself.
